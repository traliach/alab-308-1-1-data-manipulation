# ALAB 308.1.1 – Data Manipulation with JavaScript

This lab is about actice basic math and comparison operations in JavaScript using four numbers.

This is the  **Part 1** :
- Checked if the four numbers add up to 50.
- Checked if at least two of the numbers are odd.
- Checked if any number is over 25 and created a variable that is true when all numbers are 25 or under.
- Checked if all four numbers are unique.
- Checked if all numbers are divisible by 5.
- Checked if the first number is larger than the last.
- Did an arithmetic chain (subtract, then multiply, then find the remainder).

Each check is saved in a variable and logged with `console.log` so I can see clear messages in the console about what is happening.
